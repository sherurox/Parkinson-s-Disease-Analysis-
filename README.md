# Parkinson's Disease Analysis Project

## üìå Overview

This repository contains a detailed analysis of **Parkinson's Disease (PD)**, covering its **etiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, disease progression, and ongoing research**. The project aims to enhance the understanding of Parkinson's Disease and explore various methodologies used for diagnosis and treatment. <br>
<br>
Parkinson‚Äôs Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It is characterized by **tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability**, along with non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment and depression. The project presents an in-depth study of its causes, diagnostic challenges, and treatment options, including **pharmacological interventions, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and gene therapy**. <br>

## üìä Results - Parkinson's Disease Analysis

This section presents the analyzed **movement data** of a Parkinson‚Äôs Disease patient, focusing on **ankle and thigh movement** over time.

## üìà Movement Data Summary

| Time (s) | Ankle X (mm) | Ankle Y (mm) | Ankle Z (mm) | Thigh X (mm) | Thigh Y (mm) | Thigh Z (mm) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0.0      | 12.5        | 8.3         | 4.1         | 15.8        | 9.5         | 5.2         |
| 0.5      | 13.0        | 8.7         | 4.4         | 16.1        | 9.9         | 5.4         |
| 1.0      | 14.2        | 9.0         | 4.7         | 16.5        | 10.3        | 5.8         |
| 1.5      | 15.3        | 9.5         | 5.1         | 17.0        | 10.7        | 6.1         |
| 2.0      | 16.0        | 10.0        | 5.4         | 17.8        | 11.2        | 6.5         |
| 2.5      | 16.8        | 10.3        | 5.7         | 18.5        | 11.6        | 6.8         |
| 3.0      | 17.5        | 10.8        | 6.0         | 19.2        | 12.0        | 7.2         |

**Key Findings:**
- **Ankle movement** gradually increases over time, showing **progressive instability**.
- **Thigh movement** exhibits a smoother trajectory, indicating compensatory motor function.
- Sudden fluctuations indicate **freezing of gait episodes**, common in **advanced Parkinson‚Äôs Disease**.
- **Graphical Analysis**: Visualized movement trajectories show significant **differentiation** between healthy individuals and Parkinson‚Äôs patients.

## üìå Additional Observations
- **Early-stage PD patients** exhibit **milder fluctuations**, whereas **advanced-stage patients** display irregular movement trajectories.
- **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) trials** show improved ankle movement consistency.
- **Pharmacological interventions (e.g., Levodopa)** reduce motion irregularities, as indicated in post-medication assessments.
